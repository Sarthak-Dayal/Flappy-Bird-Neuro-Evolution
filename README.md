# Flappy Bird Neuroevolution
A demonstration of neuro-evolution using the game Flappy Bird written in p5.js using a custom genetic algorithm and machine learning library inspired by [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/).

## Usage

In order to use this project, [go here](https://sarthak-dayal.github.io/Flappy-Bird-Neuro-Evolution/). The speed of the game (and the training) can be changed by adjusting the slider.

This game was built with a custom neural network as well as custon graphics using p5.js. Later, I transfered the Neural Network to TensorFlow to make things faster when deploying the website.
